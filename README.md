# Geopedia : A Map Creating Tool With .xml, .geojson and .json .

Hi, it was a experimental project for my uni. In this project I aimed to create 3D maps (or map presentations) guided by .xml files and feed by .geosjon, .jsonor .csv .

# Features
1.Multiple map support in same time. <br/>
2.Map configuration with .xml. <br/>
3. .json and .csv support.

# How To Use

Just create an .xml file and add .geojson files for map drawing and .json or .csv files and configure them as I did in relations then you should execute Geopedia.py and then select maps from view mode (there is no continue button when you close the window it continues).

# Where To Find Sources

For .geojson files you can use https://www.geoboundaries.org/ <br/>
For real data you should use hand-write or extracted data from tables the files into .json or .csv.
